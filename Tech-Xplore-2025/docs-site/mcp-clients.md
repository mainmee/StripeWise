## Advanced Integration

### Custom Client Development
You can also build your own MCP client using the Model Context Protocol specification:

```typescript
import { McpClient } from '@modelcontextprotocol/client';

const client = new McpClient({
  serverUrl: 'https://your-worker.workers.dev',
  tools: ['financial_analysis', 'sustainability_tips']
});

await client.connect();
const response = await client.call('financial_analysis', {
  userId: 'user123',
  timeframe: 'last_month'
});
```

### Multi-Client Setup
Configure multiple clients to access the same MCP server:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "client": "custom_ui",
    "url": "http://localhost:8788"
  },
  "testing": {
    "client": "cloudflare_playground",
    "url": "https://your-worker.workers.dev"
  },
  "production": {
    "client": "claude_desktop",
    "url": "https://your-production-worker.workers.dev"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Client Connections

### Common Issues

#### Connection Refused
**Problem**: Client cannot connect to MCP server
**Solution**: 
- Verify server is running and accessible
- Check URL and port configuration
- Ensure firewall settings allow connections

#### Tool Discovery Failed
**Problem**: Client doesn't see available tools
**Solution**:
- Verify MCP agent is properly exposing tools
- Check tool registration in `src/mcp.ts`
- Review server logs for errors

#### Authentication Errors
**Problem**: Client authentication fails
**Solution**:
- Verify API keys and secrets are properly configured
- Check environment variable setup
- Review authentication middleware

### Testing Connection
Test your MCP server connection:

```bash
# Test server availability
curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/health

# Test MCP protocol endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "tools/list"}'
```

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use secure connections for production
- **API Key Management**: Properly secure your API keys and secrets
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for public endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs from client connections

### Performance Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections where possible
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently requested data
- **Async Operations**: Use async patterns for non-blocking operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and retry logic

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Connection Metrics**: Track client connections and usage
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor and alert on connection failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and throughput
- **User Analytics**: Understand how different clients are being used
