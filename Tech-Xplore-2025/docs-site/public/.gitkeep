# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets for the VitePress documentation site:

- `logo.svg` - Site logo (to be added)
- `favicon.ico` - Site favicon (to be added)

## Adding Assets

To add the logo and favicon:

1. Add `logo.svg` to this directory
2. Add `favicon.ico` to this directory  
3. Uncomment the logo and favicon references in `.vitepress/config.js`

The logo should be a simple SVG that works well in both light and dark themes.
The favicon should be a 32x32 or 16x16 ICO file.
