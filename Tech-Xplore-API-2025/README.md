# Investec AI-Driven Financial & Sustainability Advisor API

Mock API template for financial advisor and sustainability advisor features using Cloudflare Workers and Hono framework.

## Setup

```txt
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API Documentation

The API includes comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation:

- **Swagger UI**: Visit `/ui` to interact with the API through a web interface
- **OpenAPI Spec**: Available at `/doc` for programmatic access
- **Interactive Testing**: Test all endpoints directly from the Swagger UI

### Accessing the Swagger UI

To access the interactive Swagger documentation, you need to append `/ui` to your base URL:

#### Local Development
```
http://localhost:8787/ui
```

#### Production (After Deployment)
```
https://your-actual-worker-url.workers.dev/ui
```

**Examples:**
- If your deployed Worker URL is `https://tech-xplore-api.my-subdomain.workers.dev`, then access Swagger at:
  ```
  https://tech-xplore-api.my-subdomain.workers.dev/ui
  ```
- For local development, always use:
  ```
  http://localhost:8787/ui
  ```

**Note**: Make sure your Worker is running (locally with `npm run dev` or deployed) before trying to access the Swagger UI.

### Documentation Features

- **Comprehensive Schemas**: All request/response structures are fully documented
- **Tag-based Organization**: APIs are grouped by functionality (Core APIs, Financial Advisor, Sustainability Advisor)
- **Type Safety**: Zod schemas ensure runtime validation and TypeScript type inference
- **Examples**: All responses include realistic mock data examples

## Deployment

```txt
npm run deploy
```

### Post-Deployment Configuration

After successfully deploying your Worker, you need to update the production server URL in your OpenAPI configuration:

1. **Find your deployed Worker URL**: After deployment, Cloudflare will provide you with a URL like `https://your-project-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

2. **Update the production server URL** in `src/index.ts`:
   ```ts
   servers: [
     {
       url: 'https://your-actual-worker-url.workers.dev', // Replace with your deployed URL
       description: 'Production server',
     },
     // ... other servers
   ],
   ```

3. **Why this is important**: 
   - The Swagger UI uses this URL to make actual API calls when users test endpoints
   - Without the correct URL, the "Try it out" functionality in `/ui` won't work
   - External API clients and integrations will need the correct base URL for API calls
   - This ensures your OpenAPI documentation accurately reflects your live API endpoints

## Type Generation

[For generating/synchronizing types based on your Worker configuration run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#types):

```txt
npm run cf-typegen
```

## Adding New Mock Data and APIs

### 1. Adding New OpenAPI Endpoints

To add a new API endpoint with full OpenAPI documentation:

```ts
// 1. Define the route schema
const newRoute = createRoute({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/api/new-endpoint',
  tags: ['Your Tag'],
  summary: 'Brief description',
  description: 'Detailed description of what this endpoint does',
  responses: {
    200: {
      description: 'Success response description',
      content: {
        'application/json': {
          schema: z.object({
            data: z.string().describe('Your data description'),
            // Add more fields as needed
          }),
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

// 2. Implement the route handler
app.openapi(newRoute, (c) => {
  const response = {
    data: "your mock data"
  };
  return c.json(response);
});
```

### 2. Adding Zod Schemas

Define reusable schemas for complex data structures:

```ts
const YourSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().describe('Unique identifier'),
  name: z.string().describe('Name field'),
  amount: z.number().describe('Amount in ZAR'),
  isActive: z.boolean().describe('Active status'),
});

// Use in route definitions
schema: z.object({
  items: z.array(YourSchema),
  total: z.number(),
})
```

### 3. Mock Data Best Practices

#### OpenAPI Documentation
- **Clear Descriptions**: Use `.describe()` for all schema fields
- **Proper Tags**: Group related endpoints with meaningful tags
- **Response Examples**: Provide comprehensive examples in responses
- **Type Safety**: Use Zod schemas for runtime validation

#### Realistic Data Generation
- Use actual South African merchant names (Woolworths, Pick n Pay, Uber, etc.)
- Include realistic amounts in South African Rand (R)
- Use proper date formats (ISO 8601: `2025-06-24`)
- Include variety in categories and types

#### Data Relationships
- Ensure related data is consistent across endpoints
- Link transactions to carbon footprint calculations
- Connect spending categories to investment recommendations

#### Example Mock Data Structure
```ts
const mockTransactions = [
  {
    "id": "tx_001",
    "date": "2025-06-24",
    "merchant": "Woolworths",
    "category": "Groceries",
    "amount": 245.50,
    "carbonImpact": 2.8,
    "isRecurring": true,
    "merchantType": "supermarket",
    "location": {
      "city": "Cape Town",
      "coordinates": [-33.9249, 18.4241]
    }
  }
];
```
